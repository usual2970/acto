# Specification Quality Checklist: Points System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Feature**: [Points System Specification](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (resolved)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Clarifications Needed

The specification has **1 clarification marker** that needs to be resolved:

### Question 1: Point Value Precision

**Context**: From Edge Cases section - "How are fractional points handled?"

**What we need to know**: Should the system support decimal points (e.g., 12.5 coins) or only integers?

**Suggested Answers**:

| Option | Answer | Implications |
| ------ | ------ | ------------ |
| A | Integer values only (recommended) | Simpler implementation, easier for users to understand, no rounding errors, sufficient for most use cases (coins, tokens, stars) |
| B | Decimal values with 2 decimal places | More flexibility for promotions (e.g., 1.5x multiplier events), matches currency conventions, requires careful rounding logic |
| C | Decimal values with configurable precision per point type | Maximum flexibility, allows some point types to be integers and others decimals, adds complexity to configuration |
| Custom | Provide your own answer | Please specify the precision requirements and use cases |

**Your choice**: Integer values only

## Notes

- Specification is well-structured with 5 prioritized user stories
- **Architecture**: Dual deployment mode - standalone HTTP service OR embeddable Go library
- Comprehensive functional requirements covering all aspects (43 FRs defined, including 5 for deployment modes)
- Success criteria include functionality, reliability, performance, UX, business metrics, and scalability (23 criteria)
- Clear scope boundaries with detailed "Out of Scope" section
- Only 1 clarification needed before proceeding to planning phase
- Once clarification is provided, specification will be ready for `/speckit.plan`
- Follows Clean Architecture principles: business logic independent of delivery mechanism
